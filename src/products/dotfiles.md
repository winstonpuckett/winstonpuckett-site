# devenv

## Overview

I got tired of re-installing things with band-new machines. This is all written in bash, subject to change, but hopefully is helpful. I'm especially proud of the prompt, which is incredibly minimal, but gives a lot of info.

If you want to take a look at the features, you should probably just look through it. It's most useful as inspiration.
