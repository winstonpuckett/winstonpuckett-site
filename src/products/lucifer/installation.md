# Installation

Prerequisites:
- [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)

To install lucifer, simply run the command below:

```bash
cargo install lucifer-testing
```

Then run the next command to see that lucifer was properly installed.

```bash
lucifer --version
```

Expected output replacing X with the version number:
    vX.X.X

### Troubleshooting

#### Command not found

It's likely lucifer was installed, but is not on the path. 
1. Head to where cargo installs packages (~/.cargo/bin by default)
1. Check there is a file called "lucifer" or "lucifer.exe"
1. Add ~/.cargo/bin to your PATH.
