# Blog Generator

## Impetus 

One day I decided I wanted to write a blog. I didn't want to maintain my own CMS though, so I did some research and landed on [dev.to](https://dev.to/winstonpuckett) to host my markdown blog posts.

Then, after finding that there were no good blog generating options for dev.to (there might be now. Stackbit in particular looked promising), I decided to write my own.

This website actually is a fork of the blog generator. Go check out [the blog](/blog) if you want to see it.

## Features

- **Incredibly performant**: By using an SSG, we can ship only raw html/css/js, which means that all page loads give good performance scores.
- **A search bar**: For finding specific blog posts and topics
- **Full control**: Just fork the repo
- **Easy integrations**: with [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com), [Adsense](https://www.google.com/adsense/start/) and [Coil](https://coil.com/)
- **Social links**: For [dev.to](https://dev.to), [GitHub](https://github.com), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com).
- **Probably more**: But I've forgotten what those features are ðŸ«
